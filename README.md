# Cryptogram Puzzler

This app is for [Reddit Pygame Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/59de3x/challenge_cryptogram_puzzler/)
First time use pyglet, anyhow, done ^ v ^
  - I only have tested it in Windows and it works on version 7 & 10. Windows XP is sucked.
  - run cryptogram.py to start the game.
  - just input letters using keyboard, arrow keys to move and space get a hint.
  - in option, it is EXPERIMENTAL! ^ v ^
  - Hope you enjoy it! and any comment and advice would be great appreciate!
